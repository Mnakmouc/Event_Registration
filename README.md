# Event Registration Form

A clean, semantic HTML form for event registration. This project demonstrates a structured approach to collecting attendee information, ticket preferences, workshop selections, dietary restrictions, and payment methods – all using pure HTML5.

## Description

This is a static event registration webpage built entirely with HTML. It simulates a real‑world registration flow, capturing:

- Personal details (name, email, phone, address)
- Ticket type (Student, Regular, VIP)
- Workshop choices (with a “maximum three” guideline)
- Dietary restrictions & T‑shirt size
- Accessibility questions
- Promo code & payment method selection

The form is **fully keyboard‑navigable** and uses semantic elements like `<fieldset>`, `<legend>`, and proper `<label>` associations – a solid foundation for any front‑end developer’s portfolio.

## Features

- **Required fields** marked with an asterisk and enforced via the `required` attribute  
- **Input validation** – email format, 10‑digit phone number (via `pattern`)  
-  **Radio groups** for ticket type and payment method  
-  **Checkbox group** for workshops (visual hint: “maximum three”)  
-  **Dropdown menus** for dietary restrictions and T‑shirt sizes  
-  **Textarea** for special accessibility requests  
-  **Password‑style field** for promo code (can be changed to plain text)  
-  **Mobile‑friendly viewport** meta tag
